- make sure that the mobile menu sidebar disappears when navigating to new link/page.
- add authentication using 0auth??? (do some research)
 + set up login/register logic so that is can be used as authentication

- do some react testing! (DEFINITELY need to do some more research on that)


**
- set up with an actual database, mongoDB probably... localStorage is by no means a secure way of doing authentication and keeping data safe for rendering components

*
- style home page
