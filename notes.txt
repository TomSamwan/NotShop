***
- cart logic => when going to cart page, run the save to DB function so it updates the cart items in the real DB.

- setup login/register logic and implement with mongoDB
- use JWTs and session tokens along with authenticating through the logged in user using the backend.

- get rid of localStorage use and replace with mongoDB fetching and API routes
  + when adding to cart, maybe use localstorage AND push to db as well.
  + when pushing new cart item to db, needs to only update qty of item if duplicate (just like localstorage method does)

- do some react testing! (DEFINITELY need to do some more research on that)

- make sure that the mobile menu sidebar disappears when navigating to new link/page.

- setup API routes
  + get cart
  + remove cartitem from cart
  + modify cartitem qty

  + get login/register
  + post credentials and add logic to log in/register/return error

**
- set up with an actual database, mongoDB probably... localStorage is by no means a secure way of doing authentication and keeping data safe for rendering components
- add hydrateFallback

*
- style home page

COMPLETED

### set backend router root to /api for clarity with the frontend api functions
